# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page


## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
- This is my second challenge from FrontendMentor. It is to build a landing page for a colorful sunnyside camping (I guess?) 
- I use principally HTML and CSS in this challenge. Besides, I used Bootstrap to facilitate responsive - design more easily.
- After completing all basic stuffs I may come up with something in which JS could be used.
- I appreciate every comments to improve my current product, since I'm just a newbie in frontend web dev :)

**Happy coding everyone** ðŸš€
